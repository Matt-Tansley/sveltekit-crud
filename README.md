# sveltekit-crud

A simple CRUD app built with SvelteKit and PicoCSS. 

This demo was mostly building the UI. A dummy API was used to get, add, edit, and delete data. So, a CRUD API was not implemented, but the client-side logic to interact with the API was built. 

This project is based on this: https://refine.dev/blog/sveltekit-crud-app-with-svelte-mui/
